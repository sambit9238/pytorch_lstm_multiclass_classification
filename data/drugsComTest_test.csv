"""I have had my Implanon in since February 2011, so 14 months. It has been really great. At first I was gaining weight, but that was because of unhealthy habits. Now that I am up and moving more, drinking less soda and more water, I am losing faster than ever. I get a &quot;period&quot; every 3-4 months or so, and even then it is just 3 days of slight spotting. The only negatives I can think of are slightly decreased sex drive (which you can work through) and sometimes feeling a bit depressed (which usually lasts less than a day). If you are thinking about getting Implanon and are turned off by the possible side effects, just try it. It can be taken out any time.

"""For me and other people I have suggested this medication too it has completely changed our lives for the better. Reading reviews you often see knee jerk reactions from people suffering deeply and then taking the medication and going through the up to 4 week period of feeling worse. That is a tough 4 weeks if you felt you where already at breaking point, easy to pull out the pitch fork at that time.

But you&#039;re less likely to hear from the people who would tell you the polar opposite of that because once taking lexapro providing you are feeling better it&rsquo;s easy to leave the dark world behind and return to the light. 

My suggestion to anyone who has been recommended this, ignore stigma and try this for at least 4 weeks at your doctors direction. GL ML""",Anxiety

"""Oh my goodness..never in my life have I felt so miserable from a birth control pill. The side effects were so extreme they made everyday tasks almost unmanageable. The nausea, fatigue, and dizziness every single day really took a toll on me physically and emotionally. I would even get a tingling sensation in my hand and my legs would feel extremely heavy which caused major anxiety. I didn&rsquo;t continue this pill any longer. I was so scared of what it may have caused next. Mini pill here I come...""",Birth Control

"""I have been taking lexapro for about six months now.  I was put on it for a panic attack and mild depression.  I am someone who never takes meds unless I have too and was very worried about being on this drug because I feared the side affects when it would be time to get off.
I decided on therapy and lexapro.  I am only on ten milagrams, 39 and petite.  I can&#039;t say that this drug has caused me weight gain but if I am extra hungry I choose a healthier snack.  I will say that the first few days of taking the med I did feel tired,  and tense in my arms but I will say the panic attack attributed to that.  I am doing great I am more relaxed and happier .  Therapy is key too.  Hang in there and talk to someone!!""",Anxiety

Now I&#039;ve had a good 4 months of non-stop anxiety, paranoia, and depression that wasn&#039;t there before. I have also developed bleeding the week before my period is supposed to show up.

"""I developed severe pancreatitis and hepatitis due to gallstones. They tried morphine  first, but it makes me vomit even if they give me Zofran, Phenergan or Reglan with it. I&#039;m allergic to many medications and latex. My only previous experience with painkillers was codeine for a severe cough and Percocet for a gynecological issue. I had an anaphylactic reaction to the Percocet. Not fun. So they decided to try Dilaudid on me - at least if I had a bad reaction to it, they could treat me immediately. I was so grateful! Complete pain relief and no vomiting. No side effects either nor like I was on anything, it just made the pain stop. IV Dilaudid worked within 30 seconds. They gave me pills to take home, the pills take about 30 minutes.""",Pain
"""This is a wonderful medicine for anxiety it works within 20 mins and lasts for a long time because of its long half life. However if you are suffering from depression, especially clinical depression I would not recommend taking this. It will worsen your depression symptoms if taken too often. If you started an SSRI antidepressant it can be used early on to help with some side effects like increased anxiety in the first few weeks on the medication.""",Anxiety

"""Overall this birth control did its job, as I have not gotten pregnant since I had it inserted in August of 2014. However, I DO NOTTTTTT recommend it!! The first 3 months or so were fine, then it went haywire! I have gained 25 pounds. I am always bloated and swollen in my lower abdomen. I cramp horribly now, and I never did before. I get horrible pains to the lower left of my belly button that I never had before. I will bleed heavily for weeks at a time, and spot in between. My face/chest stay broken out. I&#039;m always exhausted and very emotional. I have been miserable!!! The only reason I haven&#039;t gotten it out sooner is because I lost my insurance and it is expensive to pay out of pocket to have it removed. Getting it removed today, actually!""",Birth Control
"""I have been on Yaz almost a month. The reason why I picked, and like this medication is because it doesn&#039;t give me mood swings, which every other birth control always causes. My complaints are that I have seen random acne pop up here and there on my face, and a little breakthrough bleeding. I also have cravings, and get super nauseous at the thought of certain foods. I am definitely a picky eater now, and would prefer not to eat, than eat something that turns my stomach (which seems to be a lot of things lately) my breasts are more &quot;perky&quot;, and all my milk from my son has dried up fairly quickly. I do get dizzy, it&#039;s happened twice only. I also feel a little spacey, but it&#039;s getting better. Not sure about weight gain, if any.""",Birth Control

"""I thought I was losing my mind, but per these reviews, I think my suspicious are founded.  I&#039;ve been on Estarylla for ~6 months as my pharmacy replaced this with the Sprintec I&#039;ve been taking for about 6 years now.  Never any issues with Sprintec, it was by far my favorite BC.  This BC is the worst I&#039;ve ever had.  I&#039;ve had months with break-thru bleeding (like 3 weeks of bleeding vs at most 1...), I&#039;ve put on about 10 lbs, I have no desire to do anything but eat and not workout (not like myself AT ALL) and no libido.  I called my OB/GYN and she immediately suspected the BC.  I will be switching back to Sprintec per her &quot;dispense as written&quot; on my prescription.

I have to say that the combination of these medications has helped me tremendously in just the month that I&#039;ve added brintellix. I no longer have panic attacks daily, I don&#039;t cry all the time anymore, I don&#039;t feel hopeless or isolated, I don&#039;t feel negative constantly anymore, &amp; I honestly feel like I&#039;m more of myself again.
